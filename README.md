# Nonprofit AI Advancements Site

Welcome to the **Nonprofit AI Advancements Site**! This project is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and serves as a minimal blog demonstrating how artificial intelligence can support nonprofit organizations.

## üì¶ Features

- **Blog with Markdown content**: Write posts in the `content/posts/` folder using frontmatter (`title`, `description`, `date`, `tags`).
- **RSS feed & sitemap**: Automatically generated at `/rss.xml` and `/sitemap.xml`.
- **SEO meta tags**: Basic SEO and social share metadata included via the base layout.
- **GitHub Pages deploy**: A GitHub Actions workflow builds the site and publishes the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch on every push to `main`.
- **Ready for Vercel** (optional): Can also be deployed to Vercel with minimal configuration.
